%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

   abstract = {Today the world of human computer interaction is an impersonal one. It is one where touch is mediated through glass and plastic. Where multi-touch means antiseptic sleek materials with little texture. Why isn’t touch more personal? Why isn’t touch more tactile? Big Huggin' is a game played with a 30 inch custom teddy bear controller. Players complete the game by providing several well-timed hugs. It is an experiment and gesture in alternative interface. Instead of firing toy guns at countless enemies or revving the engines of countless gas guzzling virtual cars, why not give a hug? The Big Huggin’ game is designed to offer reflection on the way we play and the cultural benefit of alternative play.},

This paper presents an approach to creating playful game controllers using everyday objects that have outlived their usefulness. By incorporating an Arduino microcontroller, we aimed to upcycle them and create unique controllers that can enhance the gaming experience while reducing waste and promoting sustainability. To demonstrate our approach, we created three alternative game controllers from an alarm clock, a transistor radio, and a rotary phone. We also conducted an initial user study to get feedback on the gameplay compared to traditional controllers (keyboards or mice). The results showed that our custom controllers were more enjoyable, even when participants scored lower, and that the utility, usability, and user experience were comparable to standard controllers. Further user studies are needed to ensure that the controllers are as intuitive and comfortable as possible.},

	abstract = {These days rotary dial telephones have almost been forgotten. Younger generations have never really used them and mostly only know them from movies or shows that are set in the past. The phones we use nowadays have adopted a different kind of interaction model and phones with rotary dials have become collectors items or are simply collecting dust in people’s basements. This paper tries to find novel use cases for these telephones by using them as game controller. To demonstrate the approach, the game Angry Birds 2 is selected as use case. Furthermore, a first user study to gather feedback regarding the intuitiveness and fun-factor of this approach was conducted.},

	abstract = {Alternative game controllers offer opportunities to explore player interactions and enhance game enjoyment. This paper presents an approach to creating playful game controllers using everyday objects that have outlived their usefulness. By incorporating an Arduino microcontroller, we aimed to upcycle them and create unique controllers that can enhance the gaming experience while reducing waste and promoting sustainability. To demonstrate our approach, we created three alternative game controllers from an alarm clock, a transistor radio, and a rotary phone. We also conducted an initial user study to get feedback on the gameplay compared to traditional controllers (keyboards or mice). The results showed that our custom controllers were more enjoyable, even when participants scored lower, and that the utility, usability, and user experience were comparable to standard controllers. Further user studies are needed to ensure that the controllers are as intuitive and comfortable as possible.},

	abstract = {We present TactileVR, an immersive presence and tactile feedback into virtual reality. Our system allows users free to move around and interact with physical objects and toys, which co-exist in the virtual world. By integrating tracking information from the space as well as head, hands and feet of the user, we represent this information as virtual proxies in the 3D environment. Each object has a unique appearance and behavior e.g. in an electric circuits lab toy blocks serve as switches, batteries and light bulbs. By tracking and integrating toys and other everyday objects into VR, we are able to create educational and recreational experiences for children, an environment in which they can play and learn more autonomously.},
